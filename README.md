# object-tracker
A lightweight object-tracker project in C.
#
1. ccv (C-based Computer Vision Library): As its name suggests, it's written in C and was specifically designed for performance and portability, with a focus on being embeddable. It has its own set of tracking algorithms and is a great alternative to OpenCV for resource-constrained environments.
2. SOD (Simple Object Detection): This library is an embedded, cross-platform computer vision library designed for IoT and embedded systems. It's dependency-free and written in C, with a focus on real-time processing and a simple API.
3. Color-Based Blob Tracking: For true bare-metal or very simple microcontrollers, the lightest option is to write your own image processing functions without any external libraries.
